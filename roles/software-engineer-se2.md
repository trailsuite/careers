# ![Trail Logo](/assets/trail-logo.png "Trail")

Trail is a task management app for retail and hospitality businesses. We bring UX and engineering expertise to an industry hungry for both. We help store managers and head office teams get their jobs done more easily. With [Trail](http://trailapp.com), stores spend less time on admin, and more time doing what counts - being with their customers.

We’ve already raised significant capital and signed companies such as Itsu, Tossed and Enterprise Inns. With another round of fundraising about to close, and more high street restaurants set to join, we’re showing no signs of stopping.

## The Role
Are you looking for a role that can provide real opportunities and real technical challenges at a company you can help shape? Over the next twelve months we’ll be extending our product into new businesses, regions and devices. We’ll also be growing the user base ten fold. We’re looking for a full stack engineer to help do this. Somebody driven to develop the way we work, as well as the software we write.

**_We want smart people to help us disrupt the Enterprise Software industry with consumer UX & product quality!_**

## How We Work
Trail works with a modern stack and tools like `Heroku`, `CircleCI`, `Terraform`, `AWS`, `Postgres`, `React`, `Productboard` and `Slack`. We know that TDD, automated end-to-end testing, peer reviews, and an agile workflow result in awesome products and happy customers. We also like solving interesting problems like complex domain modelling, third-party integrations, highly performant UIs and data extraction & transformation.

We’re small - and want to stay that way! We want to build a small and talented team that remains nimble whilst solving the biggest problems the industry faces. A place everybody can shape.

Trail also offer remote working and flexible hours. We don’t need to see people every day to know they’re doing a great job.

##How you work
We’re looking for people who have an excellent understanding of architecture and system design. You should have experience through the whole stack. From single page client applications to multi-page web applications and microservices. You understand the design patterns used in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, React & Angular but you’re not tied to any one thing.

You’re an entrepreneur and product focused, a compulsive maker of things.

You have been working as a software engineer for 3+ years and believe that _"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler_

**We’re building an environment for smart engineers to grow, and make things they’re proud of. If you want to be part of that experience, get in touch.**
